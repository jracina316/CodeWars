/* Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.

Examples:

1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34
*/

function opposite(number) {
    return number * -1
  }

//This one was ridiculously easy.  Let's see what other solutions there are:

function opposite(number) {
    return(-number);
  }

  function opposite(number) {
    return number * (-1);
}
