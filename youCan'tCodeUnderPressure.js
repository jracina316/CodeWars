// this one was dumb

//Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

// Code provided:

function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    return i;
  }

  //Solution Code:
  function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    return i+i;
  }
  
  //second stupidly simple answer:

  function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    return i * 2;
  }
